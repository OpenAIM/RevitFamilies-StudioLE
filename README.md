# Simple Approved Document M Compliant Revit Families

Simple, generic, and lightweight Revit Families designed with M4(2) and M4(3) compliance in mind.

By using only basic geometry we ensure the file sizes remain low, while still providing an indicative design when viewed in plan, section, and elevation.

Dimensions for each element have been taken from the Appendix D Furniture Schedule of Approved Document M, as such they're ideal for proving compliance with Building Regulations.
